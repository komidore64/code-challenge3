## Assignment

Please write a Ruby app that uses the [Github Jobs
API](https://jobs.github.com/api) to help show programming language trends
across the following cities:

| Cities        | Languages   |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Boston        | Java        |
| San Francisco | C#          |
| Los Angeles   | Python      |
| Denver        | Swift       |
| Boulder       | Objective-C |
| Chicago       | Ruby        |
| New York      | Kotlin      |
| Raleigh       | Go          |
|               | C++         |
|               | JavaScript  |

Program guidelines:
- all work done in a git repository
- unit tests
- README

The app should present following information:

```
Boston:
  - Python: 25%
  - Ruby: 10%
  - C++: 10%
  - Kotlin:  5%
San Francisco:
  - Javascript: 35%
  - Python: 10%
  - Ruby: 15%
```

That can be read as "In Boston, 25% of all current programming jobs refer to
Python". The numbers above are made up but your program should be able to give
us some indication of programming language trends across those cities based on
the information source from GitHub Jobs.

Also, add a *README* with the follow questions documented and answered.
- challenges you ran into
- areas of the code you are most proud of
- areas of the code you are least proud of
- trade-offs you made and why
- next areas of focus to move this towards production

This exercise should take you no more than 6 hours, if it does please just
commit what you've completed.
